## About
This repository contains a collection of simple fractal renderers written in C++. Currently, following fractals can be drawn:

* Barnsley Fern
* Buddhabrot
* Mandelbrot Set
* Burning Ship
* T-Squere
* H-Tree

Resulting fractals should appear in the output directory. You might need some software to view the images (GIMP for example).
